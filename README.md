## About repository
This repository contains lab work for the subject "System Analysis and Machine Simulation"

#### Lab1 - Testing a pseudorandom number generator.
Create a generator for a sequence of uniformly distributed random numbers based on the mixed Lehmer algorithm. Select the generator parameters that produce the maximum period and evaluate the generator.

#### Lab2 - Creation of a simulation model of a complex system
For a complex system, build a conceptual and software simulation model. Conduct verification by conducting a simulation experiment with repeated runs.
